# H-Bridge

> An H bridge is an electronic circuit that enables a voltage to be applied across a load in either direction. These circuits are often used in robotics and other applications to allow DC motors to run forwards and backwards.

You can buy h-bridge chips that will allow you to programatically control the bridge switches from Raspberry Pi's GPIO ports. 
You will need two ports to control an h-bridge, and you will need two h-bridges to control a step motor or a single h-bridge to control a DC motor.

The model L293D contains two h-bridges in a single chip, and is very well explained in [this YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nDaHJqruq0).
